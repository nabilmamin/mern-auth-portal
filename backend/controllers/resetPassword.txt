Sure, let's use a metaphor to explain the password reset process in your application. Imagine your application is a secure library, and users are members who have library cards (accounts) with passwords to access the library's resources.

Metaphor Explanation:
Forgot Password Request:

Scenario: A member (user) forgets their library card's PIN (password) and needs to reset it.
Action: The member goes to the library's help desk (makes a POST request to /forgot-password) and provides their email address.
Validation: The librarian (server) checks if the email is valid and belongs to a registered member.
Token Generation: If the email is valid, the librarian generates a unique reset token (like a temporary key) and stores it securely in the member's record.
Email Sent: The librarian sends an email to the member with a special link containing the reset token. This link is like a temporary key that allows the member to reset their PIN.
Reset Password:

Scenario: The member receives the email and clicks on the link to reset their PIN.
Action: The member is directed to a special page (makes a PUT request to /reset-password/:token) where they can enter a new PIN.
Validation: The librarian checks the reset token to ensure it is valid and has not expired.
Token Verification: The librarian hashes the token (like verifying the temporary key) and compares it with the stored token in the member's record.
Password Update: If the token is valid, the librarian allows the member to set a new PIN. The librarian then removes the temporary key from the member's record to ensure it cannot be reused.
Confirmation: The librarian confirms that the PIN has been successfully reset, and the member can now use their new PIN to access the library.
