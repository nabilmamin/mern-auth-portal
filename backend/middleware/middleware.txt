Middleware functions are executed before the route handlers (controllers). 
They can modify the request and response objects or terminate the request-response cycle. 

Middleware handle common logic (seperate from business logic) that need to be performed for multiple routes.

Common tasks include:
Authentication: verifying JWT tokens to ensure the user is authenticated before accessing protected routes.
Authorization: checking if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a specific route.
