A reducer is a pure function. It does not have side effects and always produces the same output given the same input. 
Reducers are part of the state management strategy. 
authReducer helps in handling state transitions based on different auth related actions:
 - loading user data
 - registering
 - logging in
 - updating the profile

 Key concepts:
 Pure function - in / out, never changes
 State Transition - determines how the state should change
 Action - an object that describes a change or event that should trigger a state update. 

Frontend auth context such as the authReducer doesnt split the logic from the backend middleware or controllers. 
Instead it manages the client-side state. The backend handles the actual authentication logic.
The front end manages the state based on the response and actions triggered by interactions with the backend.
