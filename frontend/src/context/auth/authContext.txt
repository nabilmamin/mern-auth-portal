authContext is part of the Context API setup. 
Manage and share authentication related state and actions across different components in the app.

in authReducer.js we have defined user ACTIONS and we have defined how the state should update in response to those actions.
authReducer is used as a set of rules that determine how the information should be updated in response to various actions.

authContext.js will build the CONTEXT which holds the shared state and information accessible to all components in the application.

Imagine the app is a large building with many rooms, each representing a different component. 
Managing state can be challenging if you have to pass information from one room to the other one at a time.
CONTEXT would be the central control room where all the important information and controls are.
- Holds the shared state and information that needs to be accessible to all rooms (components) in the building.
PROVIDER is the operator in the control room who manages and updates the information and controls. 
- Provider is a component that wraps the app where the context should be available. 
- Once wrapped, it provides state information to the children. 
CONSUMER are the room intercoms that allow the occupants to access information and controls. 
- Components need to access the context value, and they use the consumer to get that information.
- Consumers are the COMPONENTS 
STATE MANAGEMENT are the information and controls managed by the central control room.
- Context manages this state and ensures that it is updated and accessible to all rooms that need it.
