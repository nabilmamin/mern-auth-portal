Contexts are a way to manage and share STATE across different components in your application without having to pass props down manually at every level.
Remember useState and setState are initializing and updating different objects. 

Contexts come with a Provider and Consumer component.
Provider component is used to wrap the part of your application where you want the context (state updates) to be available.
Consumer component is used to access the context value.
