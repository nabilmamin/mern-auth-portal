Imagine you are the manager of a secure vault (the application), and someone (the user) has lost their key (password) to access their personal safe (account). They have already gone through the process of verifying their identity (via a password reset email) and now have a special one-time-use code (the token) to create a new key.

Hereâ€™s how the process works:

1. The Vault Manager Prepares the Reset Process
The manager (the ResetPassword component) is ready to help the user reset their key.
The manager receives the special code (the token) from the user when they arrive (via the URL using useParams).
The manager also has tools (resetPassword, toast, Formik, etc.) to guide the user through the process.
2. The User Fills Out a Form
The manager provides the user with a form (the password reset form) to create a new key.
The form has rules (validation schema using Yup) to ensure the new key is strong:
It must be at least 6 characters long.
It must include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The user must confirm the new key by entering it twice to ensure there are no typos.
3. The User Submits the Form
When the user submits the form, the manager starts the reset process (handleSubmit function).
The manager takes the special code (the token) and the new key (password) and sends them to the vault system (backend API) to update the lock.
4. Success or Failure
If the vault system successfully updates the lock:
The manager shows a success message ("Your password has been reset successfully").
The manager also starts a countdown (using setTimeout) to redirect the user to the login area (the /login route) so they can use their new key to access their safe.
If the vault system fails (e.g., the special code is invalid or expired):
The manager shows an error message ("Failed to reset password. Please try again.") and allows the user to try again.
5. User Experience
While the reset process is happening, the manager disables the form (isSubmitting) to prevent the user from submitting it multiple times.
If the reset is successful, the user is redirected to the login page.
If the reset fails, the user can fix any issues and try again.
Code Breakdown in the Metaphor:
The Manager Prepares:

useParams gets the special code (token) from the URL.
useNavigate is the manager's tool to guide the user to the login area after success.
useContext connects the manager to the vault system (backend API) via AuthContext.
The Form Rules:

ResetPasswordSchema ensures the new key is strong and confirmed correctly.
The Reset Process:

handleSubmit is the manager's workflow:
Sends the special code and new key to the vault system (resetPassword function).
Shows success or error messages using toast.
Redirects the user to the login area after success.
The User Interface:

If the reset is successful, the user sees a success message and is redirected.
If the reset is not successful, the user can try again.
Summary of the Metaphor:
The ResetPassword component is like a vault manager helping a user reset their lost key. It ensures the new key is strong, securely updates the lock, and guides the user back to the login area to use their new key. If anything goes wrong, the manager provides clear feedback and allows the user to try again.
